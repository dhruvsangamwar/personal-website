To the soles that carried my soul,

You entered my life on an unassuming summer day, relieving me of my feet ache from carrying my comically heavy backpack through Europe. Since then you've shown me views of canyons, mountains, beaches, caves and various cities. I've stood on you, firm, experiencing what this world has to offer. Sturdy, reliable and always ready – you never once complained about the weight I asked you to bear. For a so called lifeless object, you've filled my days with life beyond imagination. 

Together we've found sunsets and sunrises in the most unexpected places – through quiet alleyways, atop cliffs without the comfort of a trail. You've carried me into moments of stillness and awe, where time ceased to exist and I was absorbed by the present. Shared my happiness, sorrow, struggle and exhaustion. With you by my side, it's always been one foot in front of the other. You've saved my life on more than one occasion, and made me feel sure of every next step.

So thank you—for every blister, every worn-out tread, every mile shared.

Yours in every step, 
Dhruv
