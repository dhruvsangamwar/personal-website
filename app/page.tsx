        I am currently working as a software engineer at 
        <span className="font-bold"> PNI Sensor </span>, 
        where I develop software supporting alternative positioning, navigation, and timing sensors. 
        Recently, I have been working with Android (Kotlin), Rust, and C. My interests include databases, 
        distributed systems, computer networks, and natural language processing.

        I studied Computer Science at 
        <span className="font-bold"> University of California, Davis </span>, 
        where I had the opportunity to teach a class on algorithms and competitive programming 
        and help manage Neurotech@Davis. I also contributed to research studying governance in Apache Open Source projects.
